# protocol-checkin-cycle - run the weekly review loop

Check-ins are where coaching actually happens. The job is to read the trend, not to restate this
week's numbers back at the operator.

## When to use

- "Run this week's check-ins", "log Sarah's weigh-in", "who hasn't checked in?"
- "Write up my notes from the call with Marcus"

## Steps

A worked end-to-end example of this task: [recipe](./references/recipe.md).

1. Find who is due: `find` with `kind: "progress"` (or `review_inbox` for the wider "what needs
   me" bundle - see `../protocol-inbox-triage`).
   Check the dates before you promise "this week". Real accounts are irregular - clients log every
   few weeks, not every Monday - so a strict seven-day window can come back nearly empty while a
   hundred people genuinely need reviewing. Say what window you actually used.
2. For each client, read their history with `review_client` before judging a single entry. One heavy
   week after a holiday is not a trend.
   **Pass an explicit `limit` whenever you are looking at a trend.** `find` caps at 20-25 by default;
   a client with four years of check-ins gives you the most recent 25 unless you ask for more. The
   response tells you: `defaultLimitApplied` means you did not set one, `truncated` means you exactly
   filled the one you set. Either way you are not looking at the whole history yet.
   The list rows carry only dates and status - **measurements come from `get kind=progress`**, one
   per entry. Budget for that before promising a full-history analysis.
3. Record with `record_progress`, choosing the right `action`:
   - `entry` - a check-in's numbers
   - `report` - triage an AI progress report
   - `note` - a meeting note

   **Correcting a number** ("she misread the scale, it was 80.4") is `entry` with the
   `progressEntryId` and only the metric that changed - the rest are left alone, and the
   body-composition weights recompute. The response echoes the resulting `measurements`: read it.
   A correction can change the whole reading of a client - one that turned a "stalled" client into
   a steady five-month loss - so it is worth being sure it landed before you write anyone up.

   Numbers are numbers, never strings, and `energy` / `mood` / `adherence` / `sleepQualityScore`
   are **1-10, not percentages**. Full key list in
   `../protocol-reference/references/surface-clients.md`.
4. Where the trend genuinely warrants a programming change, say so and hand off to
   `../protocol-build-program` or `../protocol-nutrition`. Do not silently change the plan.
5. Summarise for the operator by exception - who needs them, and why.

## Rules

- Read at least a few weeks of history before recommending a change. Reacting to one data point is
  the most common way to make coaching worse.
- Write notes the way a coach would - specific and human. Never produce a template with the numbers
  swapped in.
- Logging a check-in or a note is a write, and reaches nobody.
- **Approving a report is different: it publishes to the client, immediately, with no platform
  gate.** `reportAction=approve` is a plain write that Protocol applies the moment you call it -
  there is no confirmation step and no push notification, and nothing on the platform is waiting
  for a tap. The only thing standing between a draft and the client seeing it is you not calling
  `approve` until the operator has explicitly told you to send this one. Get the
  `clientFacingSummary` right *before* you approve - approval requires one, and it is what the
  client reads. `update` the draft as many times as you like; approve once, deliberately, and only
  when told to.
- Everything else here reaches nobody. If the operator wants the client told about something,
  that is `../protocol-scheduling` or a message they send themselves.
- **If the numbers aren't there, the form is why.** A check-in question only becomes a measurement
  when it carries a `mapTo`; without one the answer is stored as text and never charts. When a
  client's history is all prose and no numbers, check their check-in form before concluding they
  aren't tracking - see `mapTo` in `../protocol-reference/references/surface-clients.md`.
