# protocol-build-program - build and assign training

Programs are the heart of Protocol. Two things ruin them: building from assumptions instead of the
client's profile, and confusing a template with a client's copy.

## When to use

- "Build Sarah a 12-week strength block", "add a deload week", "change his Tuesday session"
- "Assign the hypertrophy template to Marcus"

## Steps

A worked end-to-end example of this task: [recipe](./references/recipe.md).

1. Read the client first (see `../protocol-client-review`). Training age, injuries, available days,
   and equipment all come from the profiles - build to those, not to a generic template.
2. Confirm the exact parameter names in `../protocol-reference/references/surface-programming.md` before
   writing. `build_program` and `build_workout` have specific, easy-to-mistake argument shapes.
3. Build the structure with `build_program` (metadata, phases, content), and individual sessions with
   `build_workout`. **Send a workout's metadata and its `exercises` in the SAME call.** Creating the
   workout first and adding exercises after means a second call, and if you omit `workoutId` on it
   you create a *second, empty* workout rather than filling the first - the coach's library ends up
   with a duplicate of every session.
4. For a **mixed block** (training + nutrition in one program - the usual shape), attach both on the
   phase: `workoutDays` carries `{ workoutIds: [...] }` per day, `nutritionDays` carries
   `{ plannedNutritionTemplates: [...] }` per day. They are separate arrays on the same week, seven
   entries each. Nutrition placed on a `workoutDay` is silently not rendered.
5. Assign with `assign_program` — `action: "assign"`, the source as **`copyFromProgramId`** (not
   `programId`, which is what the other actions use), and the client as `userId`. Both are required;
   without the source you would create an empty plan for that client.
   Assigning **deep-copies** the template into an independent client copy, all the way down: the
   workouts and nutrition templates are duplicated too. Later edits to the client's program - or to
   its sessions - do not touch the template, and vice versa. Edit the client's copy to change that
   client; edit the source to change what the next person gets.
6. Read the program back with `get` and confirm the phases and exercises actually landed.
7. Tell the operator what you built in their language - the shape of the block and why, not a dump
   of every set.

## Rules

- **Editing a live program? `get` it first and keep every week you are not changing.** `phases`
  replaces the ENTIRE phase list, and each row needs one control key: `{ add: true, name: "Week 1" }`
  to create, `{ ref: "<phaseId>" }` to keep a week untouched, `{ modify: "<phaseId>", … }` to change
  one. A week you omit is deleted, so such a write is refused with the weeks listed: show the coach
  and repeat with `confirmDelete: true` only on their yes. Note `add` is a **boolean** here - in
  `build_nutrition` it names the row type instead. Full grammar:
  `../protocol-reference/references/surface-programming.md`.
- **A replaced block is expired, not paused.** When a new mesocycle takes over, end the old one with
  `assign_program action=expire` (EXPIRED, ends today); `deactivate` means "on hold".
- `exercises` **replaces** the whole exercise list on a workout - and so does a group's own nested
  `exercises` array. Changing one movement in a superset means sending that group's complete list
  with `{ ref: <exerciseId> }` for the ones you are keeping. Read the current list, merge, write it
  all back.
- **A workout is two levels: groups, then movements inside them.** A movement needs a real
  `exerciseId` (resolve it with `find kind=exercise` - a name is not a reference), `sets`, and
  `repRule`. There is no `reps` field.
- **Prescribe rest.** `restAfterSeconds` on each exercise, `restAfterGroupSeconds` on the block.
  Real coaches set it on most exercises; a session without rest reads half-finished to a client.
- **Never put a client's name in a workout or nutrition-template title.** Assigning deep-copies
  those titles **verbatim** to the next client, so a session called "Sarah - Upper A" ends up in
  Marcus's plan still saying Sarah. Name them by what they are: "Upper A - Push", "Cut Block Daily
  Nutrition". The program name is where the client belongs, and `assign` lets you set that per copy.
- **Assigning multiplies rows, and that is normal.** The copy duplicates a workout or template once
  per day it is referenced - a 4-week block referencing one daily nutrition plan produces 28 copies.
  That is how ~99.7% of this product's real programs are shaped, so do not "clean it up" or report it
  as a fault. It also means edits to the client's copy are per-day: change the session on the day
  you mean.
- **The id you place is often not the id that lands.** A program owns everything inside it: on
  every phases write the server copies any referenced workout or nutrition template that is a
  library row, belongs to another client, belongs to another program, or is already on another day
  of this one, and points the day at the copy instead. You cannot opt out and do not need to do it
  yourself - but never assume your ids survived. `get` the program back before reasoning about what
  is on which day. Nutrition templates are the one exception that may repeat across weeks.
- **Say whose work you used.** `find scope=mine|team|all` chooses a shelf and every row carries its
  `visibility`. If you built a plan out of the team's shared library rather than this coach's own,
  tell them - they will find out later otherwise. Ask with `scope`; never assemble the filter from
  an owner and a visibility yourself, because half of "mine" reads every private row in the tenant.
- **`repRule` is a structured grammar, not prose** - `"8-10"`, `"10 / 8 / 6"`, `"10x25kg"`, `"30s"`.
  Free text ("AMRAP", "to failure", "60s hold") is rejected, because the coach's own builder would
  render it as invalid. Unilateral work has no notation: keep `repRule` numeric and say "each side"
  in `notes`.
- **Read `failCount` on every write.** These verbs are best-effort: rows they cannot parse are
  skipped, and the call still succeeds. A response carrying `failCount: 2` built two fewer weeks than
  you asked for, and only the number tells you.
- Never edit a template when the operator meant a client's assigned copy. If it is ambiguous, ask.
  The two are fully independent after an assign, so the wrong choice is silent: the change lands
  somewhere real, just not where the operator meant. `find kind=program` with the client's id shows
  which copies are theirs.
- Use round, coachable numbers - real set and rep schemes, sensible session lengths. Mirror the
  conventions already in the coach's other programs.
- Building and assigning are writes, not outward actions. Nothing here notifies the client.
