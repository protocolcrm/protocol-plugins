# protocol-onboard-client - create a client worth programming for

A client record with only a name is not useful. Onboarding means the profiles are filled in well
enough that a program can actually be built from them.

## When to use

- "Add a new client", "set up Marcus", "put her intake into Protocol"
- "Move him to active", "she's a lead now" - lifecycle stage changes.

## Steps

A worked end-to-end example of this task: [recipe](./references/recipe.md).

1. Check the person does not already exist: `find` with `kind: "client"` and their name. Duplicate
   clients are painful to merge later.
2. Create the record with `manage_client` using its `create` object.
3. Fill in whichever of the four profiles the operator gave you material for - health, fitness,
   nutrition, behavioural. These are separate sub-resources on the same call; see
   `../protocol-reference/references/data-model.md`. **Starting numbers are not profile fields:**
   weight, body fat and girths go in as the client's first check-in (`record_progress
   action=entry`, dated today), and age becomes `dateOfBirth` - ask for it if you only have the age.
4. Set the lifecycle stage if the operator named one.
5. Put them on a check-in. A client nobody measures cannot be coached from data later. Reuse the
   tenant's existing check-in form (`find` with `kind: "form"`) rather than making a new one -
   a second form fragments the history. If you do build one, **every question that records a number
   needs a `mapTo`**, or the answers are stored as text and never reach the client's measurements:
   see `../protocol-reference/references/surface-clients.md` under `manage_forms`.
6. Read the client back with `review_client` and tell the operator what is still missing before a
   program can be built - do not quietly leave gaps.

## Rules

- Never invent intake data. If the operator did not give you a training age, a goal, or an injury
  history, leave the field empty and say which ones you left.
- Ask before creating a client whose name closely matches an existing one.
- Client creation is a write, not an outward action - it runs autonomously. Nothing here messages the
  client.
