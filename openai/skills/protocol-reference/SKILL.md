# protocol-reference - the ground truth for Protocol's surface

Protocol exposes its whole CRM as **18 intent verbs** rather than a tool per endpoint. Each verb is
fat: one `schedule` verb books appointments, configures booking, and fires reminders, chosen by an
`action` argument. That density is why this reference exists - the verb name tells you almost nothing
about what a given call will do.

## When to use

- Before any structural write (`build_program`, `build_workout`, `build_nutrition`, `manage_forms`),
  to confirm the exact parameter names.
- When you need the `find` / `get` entity kinds, or a verb's action enum.
- When you are unsure whether something is even reachable over MCP - see `references/guardrails.md`.
- When a call returned success but the data looks unchanged - read `references/pitfalls.md` first.

## How this coach works, versus how Protocol works

This reference is the ground truth for the *surface*. It cannot tell you how this particular
business coaches, and that is the half that makes the work feel right or wrong to the operator.
Real accounts differ completely: one tracks every meal against a food library, another writes
recipes as free text with no macros anywhere, a third delivers menus as content sections rather
than templates at all. Same tools, three unrecognisable houses.

So before a structural write, check whether this operator already has their own documented way of
doing this: their own project skills (wherever they keep them in their setup) and their own standing instructions outrank anything here. When the coach corrects you on how it is done here rather than on
a fact, offer to record the correction, either in the user's own custom instructions or as a project skill,
so it persists for next time instead of getting re-explained. The things worth remembering in
coaching, from what these accounts actually do:

- Naming: what programs, phases and templates are called, and what they are never named after.
- The nutrition model: food-library macros, recipe text, or menu-as-content.
- Check-in rhythm: which day, what gets reviewed, what a "bad week" is worth acting on.
- Rep and load notation, session structure, warm-up and finisher conventions.
- Who gets seen personally and who runs on templates.

## Steps

1. Read the reference you need, all in `references/` beside this file:
   - `surface-core.md` - **start here**: `find`/`get`, the entity kinds, and the replace grammar
     every array parameter follows. The three below assume it.
   - `surface-programming.md` - `build_program`, `build_workout`, `build_nutrition`,
     `assign_program`, `manage_library`.
   - `surface-clients.md` - `manage_client`, `record_progress`, `manage_forms`, `review_client`,
     `message`.
   - `surface-operations.md` - `manage_tasks`, `manage_media`, `schedule`, `manage_automations`,
     `review_inbox`.
   - `data-model.md` - clients, profiles, programs, templates, lifecycle stages.
   - `guardrails.md` - what you will not do without the coach's approval, and the access tiers.
   - `pitfalls.md` - the failure modes, led by parameter-name fidelity.
   - `pointers.md` - where to go outside this pack: the help.protocolcrm.com section map and the
     live REST API's OpenAPI schema.
2. Quote parameter names from the reference rather than guessing from the shape of a previous call.
3. After a structural write, re-read the entity with `get` and confirm the field actually landed.

## Rules

- A wrong parameter name is **silently dropped and still returns success**. Never assume a 200 means
  the data saved - verify structural writes by reading them back.
- Array parameters like `exercises` and `questions` **replace** the whole array. Read, merge, then
  write the complete list, or you will delete the rest of it.
- Never invent an entity kind or an action value. If it is not in the surface files, it does not exist.
