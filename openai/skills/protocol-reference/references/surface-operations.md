# Protocol MCP surface - running the practice

The calendar, the kanban, the media library, the inbox, and automations - the operational half
that is not about one client's programming. Assumes `surface-core.md`.

> **One of four.** The surface is split by the job you are doing, so you read the part you need
> rather than all 19 verbs:
>
> | File | Verbs |
> |---|---|
> | `surface-core.md` | `find` · `get` · the kind table · the replace grammar · `report_to_developers` |
> | `surface-programming.md` | `build_program` · `build_workout` · `build_nutrition` · `assign_program` · `manage_library` |
> | `surface-clients.md` | `manage_client` · `record_progress` · `manage_forms` · `review_client` · `message` |
> | `surface-operations.md` | `manage_tasks` · `manage_media` · `schedule` · `manage_automations` · `review_inbox` · `manage_support` |

### `manage_tasks`

Required: `action`. 16 actions.

`create_task` · `update_task` · `complete_task` · `move_task` · `archive_completed` ·
`create_subtask` · `update_subtask` · `toggle_subtask` · `reorder_subtasks` · `create_board` ·
`update_board` · `create_column` · `update_column` · `reorder_columns` · `create_label` ·
`update_label`

Everything except `action` is forwarded verbatim; pass the fields that action needs.

| Param | Type | Typically used by |
|---|---|---|
| `taskId` | string | task + subtask actions |
| `subtaskId` | string | update_subtask, toggle_subtask |
| `subtaskIds` | string[] | reorder_subtasks |
| `boardId` | string | board + column actions |
| `columnId` | string | move_task, update_column |
| `columnIds` | string[] | reorder_columns |
| `labelId` | string | update_label |
| `title` | string | tasks / subtasks |
| `name` | string | boards / columns / labels |
| `description` | string | tasks |
| `dueAt` | string | tasks — `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `clientId` | string | tasks |
| `assigneeId` | string | tasks / subtasks |
| `isDone` | boolean | toggle_subtask |
| `position` | integer | move_task, columns |
| `color` | string | labels / columns / boards |
| `icon` | string | boards |
| `wipLimit` | integer | columns |
| `isDoneColumn` | boolean | columns |
| `isArchived` | boolean | boards |
| `defaultColumns` | string[] | create_board |

Task/board reads go through `find` (`kind=task`, `kind=board`) and `get`.

**Labels.** `create_label` makes one (name + color, both required); `find kind=task_label` lists
them; `labelIds` on create_task/update_task puts them ON a task, replacing whatever was there. Ids
that do not resolve are skipped silently by the service, so the write reports back
`unresolvedLabelIds` — check it. Filter by them with `find kind=task labelIds=[...]`.

**Assignees.** A task can have several: `assigneeIds` replaces the set, `assigneeId` is a
one-owner convenience. Unresolved ids come back as `unresolvedAssigneeIds`. Subtasks take a single
`assigneeId`.

**The filters that answer the usual questions.** `find kind=task` takes `isOverdue` ("what's
late?"), `assigneeId` ("what's on Ana's plate?"), `labelIds`, `dueAfter`/`dueBefore`, `priority`,
`columnId`, `boardId`, `isArchived` and a free-text `searchTerm` that also matches label names.

**`title` names a task or subtask; `name` names a board, column or label.** Send the wrong one and
it is silently dropped - the write returns success and nothing changes. `create_task` also needs a
`boardId` or a `columnId`; a title alone is refused. The per-action parameter list is published on
the `action` enum - read it rather than guessing, because anything an action does not read is
dropped rather than rejected. `reorder_subtasks` / `reorder_columns` take the COMPLETE id list.

### `manage_media`

Required: `action`. 6 actions.

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `action` | string enum | **Required.** `attach` · `update` · `create_category` · `update_category` · `share` · `update_share` |
| `mediaId` | string | |
| `categoryId` | string | |
| `shareId` | string | |
| `url` | string | `attach`: the hosted asset URL. There is no raw upload path. |
| `name` | string | Also the free-text filter key on `find kind=media`. |
| `type` | string | `IMAGE` · `VIDEO` · `AUDIO` · `FILE` · `DOCUMENT` · … |
| `thumbnailUrl` | string | |
| `userId` | string | Assign media / scope a category to this client. |
| `categoryIds` | string[] | |
| `color` | string | |
| `iconEmoji` | string | |
| `order` | integer | |
| `parentId` | string | Nested category. |
| `description` | string | |
| `shareType` | string enum | `PUBLIC` · `USER_SPECIFIC` — **create only**; `update_share` cannot re-type a share (recreate it). |
| `sharedWithUserIds` | string[] | |
| `permission` | string enum | `READ` · `WRITE` |
| `expiresAt` | string | ISO datetime. |
| `isActive` | boolean | |

Shares never send an email.

`categoryIds` **replaces** the media's category set. To add one more folder, `get` the media, send
all its existing ids plus the new one - otherwise you quietly unfile it from the rest.

### `review_inbox`

No required param — `action` defaults to `overview`. 5 actions.

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `action` | string enum | `overview` (default) · `mark_read` · `mark_all_read` · `dismiss_insight` · `mark_insight_read` |
| `notificationId` | string | `mark_read` |
| `insightId` | string | `dismiss_insight`, `mark_insight_read` |
| `insightLimit` | number | `overview`: how many insights (default 25, max 200), highest priority first. |

`overview` returns `{ dashboard, notifications, unreadCount, insights, insightsTotal,
insightBreakdown }`, each section null-safe. **`insights` is the top 25, not all of them** - a real
account had 518. `insightsTotal` and `insightBreakdown` (counts by type and severity) describe the
whole set, so describe the pile honestly - "518 active, mostly plateau warnings, here are the 25
that matter" - rather than reporting 25 as if it were everything. Raise `insightLimit` only when
you are genuinely working the whole list; it is the most expensive read on the surface.

### `schedule`

Required: `action`. 7 actions.

| Param | Type | Action | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action` | string enum | — | **Required.** `create` · `update` · `cancel` · `reminder` · `booking_config` · `gcal_disconnect` · `send_reminder` |
| `appointmentId` | string | update, cancel, send_reminder | |
| `title` | string | create, update, reminder | |
| `startTime` | string | create, update, reminder | ISO-8601 instant. |
| `endTime` | string | create, update | ISO-8601 instant. |
| `clientId` | string | create, reminder | |
| `type` | string | create, update | |
| `modality` | string | create, update | |
| `location` | string | create, update | |
| `description` | string | create, update, reminder | |
| `status` | string | update | |
| `formId` | string | reminder | The check-in form the reminder asks for. |
| `recurrenceRule` | string | reminder | |
| `responseWindowHours` | number | reminder | |
| `reminderHoursBefore` | number | reminder | |
| `reminderType` | string | reminder | |
| `read` | boolean | booking_config | `true` reads the config instead of writing it. |
| `trainerId` | string | booking_config | |
| `bookingUrlSlug` | string | booking_config | |
| `sharedAvailabilities` | object[] | booking_config | `{dayOfWeek 1-7, startTime "HH:MM:SS", endTime, timezoneId, isActive}`. Full replace — **omit to preserve**. |
| `globalSettings` | object | booking_config | |
| `eventConfigurations` | object[] | booking_config | |

`booking_config` write: pass `sharedAvailabilities`, `globalSettings`, **and**
`eventConfigurations` together — the write path expects all three even though the verb's own schema
does not mark them required. `globalSettings.maximumAdvanceDays` is restricted to
`7` · `14` · `30` · `60` · `90` to stay in lock-step with the coach dashboard's own preset picker.

`send_reminder` is outward — it reaches the client. Confirm before firing it.

#### Recurring check-ins, and the booking page

`action: "reminder"` is how a weekly check-in gets scheduled: `clientId` + `formId` + `startTime`
(the FIRST occurrence) + `recurrenceRule`, an iCal RRULE - `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO`, or
`FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2;BYDAY=FR` for fortnightly. Defaults: `responseWindowHours` 48,
`reminderHoursBefore` 0 (fires at the occurrence), `reminderType` PROGRESS_CHECK_IN.

**This call is outward, not configuration.** Despite reading like a scheduling setting, `reminder`
arms a real client-facing push, and it fires within minutes if `startTime` is now or in the past
(a `startTime` in the future just delays it to that time, it does not make the call itself safe to
skip approval for). Confirm with the coach what will be sent and to whom before calling it, the
same as `send_reminder` above.

`action: "booking_config"` writes the coach's **public** booking page. **Read it first**
(`read: true`). `globalSettings` is merged, so send only the keys you are changing;
`sharedAvailabilities` and `eventConfigurations` are whole-array replaces, so **omit them unless
you mean to rewrite them** - a real coach has ~66 availability slots and a short list deletes the
rest. `maximumAdvanceDays` must be one of 7 / 14 / 30 / 60 / 90.

`modality` is closed: `IN_PERSON` · `VIRTUAL` · `HYBRID` · `ASYNCHRONOUS`.

**Two actions on this verb are outward, not one.** `send_reminder` fires a reminder now.
`reminder` is not the plain write it looks like either: despite the name, it arms a recurring
client push that fires within minutes if `startTime` is now or in the past, so treat it exactly
like `send_reminder`, confirm with the coach before calling it. `create`, `update`, `cancel`,
`booking_config`, and `gcal_disconnect` are the ones that are genuinely internal writes and reach
nobody.

### `manage_automations`

Required: `action`. 6 actions.

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `action` | string enum | **Required.** `create` · `update` · `activate` · `pause` · `archive` · `run` |
| `automationId` | string | Required for everything except `create`. |
| `name` | string | `create` |
| `kind` | string | `create` — enumerate valid kinds via `find kind=automation_kind`. |
| `config` | object | Kind-specific config. |
| `triggerConfig` | object | Kind-specific trigger config. |
| `triggerData` | object | `run`: kind-specific trigger payload. |

`create` lands the automation in DRAFT. `run` **dispatches an execution now**: outward. Read a
run's outcome with `find kind=automation_run` + `automationId`.
`PROGRESS_REPORT` is the one registered kind (triggers `PROGRESS_ENTRY_CREATED` and `MANUAL`);
confirm with `find kind=automation_kind` before assuming another exists. `run` needs
`triggerData` - for PROGRESS_REPORT that is `{ entryId: "<progress entry uuid>" }`. **`run` is the
only outward action here, and it is the one held to the `send` tier** (see `guardrails.md`): if
this connection is at `write` (the default), calling `run` is refused with a
`PermissionDeniedError` naming the tier needed - that is expected, not a bug, so tell the coach
plainly and stop rather than escalating or falling back to `protocol-rest-escape`. If the
connection is at `send`, confirm with the coach before calling it anyway: getting the payload
wrong still dispatches a real, client-facing execution, so it costs more than a wasted call.
Authoring (create/update/activate/pause/archive) is a plain write, at `write` tier. Read what an
execution actually did with `find kind=automation_run`.

### `manage_support`

Required: `action`. 2 actions.

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `action` | string enum | **Required.** `comment` · `set_status` |
| `ticketId` | string | Required by both actions. |
| `body` | string | `comment`: the comment text. |
| `status` | string | `set_status`: `OPEN` · `IN_PROGRESS` · `DONE`. |
| `priority` | string | `set_status`: `LOW` · `NORMAL` · `HIGH` · `URGENT` — Protocol team only, same as `status`. |

This works a support ticket that **already exists** — list and read them with `find` / `get`
`kind=support_ticket`. Filing a NEW ticket is not an action here: use `report_to_developers` (see
`surface-core.md`), which now files a tracked ticket (`source: AGENT`) in addition to its email.

`comment` appends to the ticket's thread. `authorSide` (`COACH` vs `PROTOCOL`) is derived from the
caller's own role, never from input, so a coach's comment can never be posted as Protocol.

**`set_status` is Protocol team only.** A coach's agent can read and comment on a ticket it filed,
but calling `set_status` is refused with a permission error reading "Only the Protocol team can
change a ticket status" — it names no tier, because this is not a tier restriction at all: it is
the service enforcing role, not the connection's `write`/`send` tier, so no tier upgrade fixes it
and no coach role can move a ticket's status or priority, ever. Passing neither `status` nor
`priority` is a harmless no-op that leaves the ticket untouched.

`find kind=support_ticket` is scoped by **ownership, not tenancy**: a coach sees only the tickets
they personally filed. The `status` / `area` / `tenantId` / `query` filters on `find` only do
anything for a Protocol (ADMIN/SYSTEM) caller — a coach's list ignores them rather than erroring.
